# Final-Project
Immune System is a complicated system, and it plays a really important role when we take various medicine. 
So, basically, we decide to stimulate how the immune system works after taking atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel. 
By comparing the tumor size, amount of T cells and antigen releasing rate, we could know which medicine works better. 
Therefore, four module is established to mimic the immune system, which are the cancer module, 
the T cell module, and the APC module, and the checkpoints module. Each module are connected and 
placed in one function. Different parts are connected by Hill Equations. By adding atezolizumab, checkpoint affinity will get influenced
and by adding nab-paclitaxel, a chemotherapy medicine, is working on changing the cytokines producing rate and antigen releasing rate. 

Two modules will be done by each person and connection between various elements in the immune system is listed below.

All the data is from the Github link listed below and the paper we mimiced is [1].
